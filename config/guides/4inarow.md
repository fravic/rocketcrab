4 in a Row is a board game in which two players compete to get four pieces in a line, on any row, column, or diagonal.

To drop a piece, simply tap on a column when it is your turn. Your piece will drop to the bottom of that column. Players then take turns dropping pieces until a player wins, or until the board is filled.
